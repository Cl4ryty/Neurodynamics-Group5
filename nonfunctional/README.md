This folder contains:
- notes on the modifications we made to the snn toolbox and the errors that lead us to make them (the modified version of the snn toolbox can be found [here](https://github.com/Cl4ryty/spinnaker_test/tree/testing/temp/1657821641.3202584/0/snntoolbox))
- code used for converting the tensorflow ANN to a nengo ANN

The (nonfunctional) code for running the SNN converted with the SNN toolbox on SpiNNaker can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/Cl4ryty/spinnaker_test).
